The Spriggan now comes with a completely new <strong>Grow </strong>mechanic for his items: you start with special <strong>Sprout</strong> Items in your item slots and using a small number of dedicated Hero Cards you can grow these sprouts into various items. These items are still the main Vitality buffer for the Spriggan as he has a very low base Vitality. The new item concepts allows to easily introduce more items for the Spriggan without needing dedicated Hero Cards. It also allows the Spriggan to constantly adapt and optimize his items to the current battle situation. </p>

When starting the Spriggan only has his brown starting sprout items available and some of his white items. This allows the Spriggan to gain new, optional items by finding them like other heroes. There are also improved sprout items the Spriggan gains when reaching Journeyman level. These allow him to directly grow stronger items from the initial sprout. As you can also see there are often alternative items available that are usually optimized for dedicated situations - for example to improve the Spriggans defense or his attack capability.&nbsp;<br><br>I've also improved/changed many of the Spriggans cards and added various new cards (due to the removal of the old "Item" hero cards we got additional design space for new hero cards.</p>

                                <p class="block-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I've completely reworked the Skald - while one could say that he was unique in the sense that you had to play all cards at the start of the Hero Cycle it just was not fun - at least for me. It resulted in two things: the Skald player had to think quickly as everybody had to wait for him. More importantly, the Skald player than had to watch what all other player did and had nothing to do until the start of the next Hero Cycle. <br><br>There are many other small and big things that I did not like: while described as a very mobile hero the Skald had no movement cards and would often even had to stand still to get the most out of his Verses. The Skald also did not have to roll to hit, taking out another base game mechanic. Many hero cards also had very limited ranges (often 1) and I've changed that so that the equipped Instrument now often defines the range. In addition the Skald now has the ability to equip a weapon in his secondary slot and some special hero cards that allow him to attack.<br><br>There are so many changes, I cannot list them all. Please have a look at the new hero cards and see if you like this variant...<br><br></p>

                                <p class="block-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This Skald variant has a completely new mechanic how songs are played. The Skald player has special <strong>Tempo</strong> cards that are not drawn from the hero deck but are always available. The Skald can increase or decrease the tempo he would like to play at the beginning of the Hero Cycle. Based on the chosen tempo, he can play a certain number of <strong>Verses</strong> at a certain base difficulty. Each <strong>Verse</strong> also comes with a difficulty and combined they set the target number the Skald player has to roll to successfully play the Verse. <br><br>The picture shows the 3 basic <strong>Tempo</strong> cards: <em>Lento (Slow)</em>, <em>Moderato (Medium)</em> and <em>Allegro (Fast)</em>. The song target number (TN) increases with higher speed and also when the Skald moves aggressively. So while you can play more Verses while having <em>Allegro (Fast)</em> ongoing, you have a higher risk of failing at playing the Verse. There are also 2 example Verses shown - as you can see these also have a target number that is added to the base TN from the Tempo card and gives the number you have to roll. There's also an example hero card shown that allows you to attack with your secondary weapon, however these attacks also integrate with the played Verses.&nbsp;<br><br>You can also see 2 example items - note that the Instruments now come with a range that is used when playing your Verses.</p>
